# Kempe-Massey Interview Study for Regulatory Compliance Perceptions 

## Summary of Artifacts

This artifact was the interview guide used to conduct the 15 interviews in our
RE 2021 study, which consisted of two phases: a pilot study (six interviewees)
and a main study (15 interviewees).  The guide supports participants with
varied backgrounds, domains, and levels of experience in their current role.
It also supports options for interviewing both technically-oriented and
policy-oriented participants.  We used the technically oriented protocol for 14
of the interviews and the law-and-policy protocol for the remaining interview
our of a recruitment pool of 29 individuals from a mix of both backgrounds. 

The guide can be used either as as starting point for new research in this
area or as a replication or reproduction of our RE 2021 paper.

## System Requirements

You must have a computer system capable of displaying or printing PDF files.
It's possible that you could find a computer system that is not capable of
doing this, but it would be pretty hard.  If you are a time traveler stuck in
the past with a copy of this repository, I would recommend reinventing the PDF
format to be something more secure rather than reimplementing it for the sake
of opening this interview guide.

## Installation Instructions

You may need to double click on the PDF file in this repository to open it.

## Steps to Reproduce

The methods needed to execute the study are outlined in our paper.  As with any
good qualitative research, you may need to adapt the methods, including our
coding scheme, to fit the population under examination.
